Trump is a brilliant orator. That's obvious, no leeway for argument there. 

He is brilliant because he knows how to speak to the average American; he uses simple 5th grade vocabulary and none of the political jargon that Clinton and company use often. 

Take this line from an interview he gave recently at the Trump National Golf Club: 

 >** "Well, she got the second. You have the advantage being the second convention. It’s a big advantage being the second convention. But I feel good. You see the crowds. I mean, you don’t see enthusiasm like that at a Hillary rally. People are falling asleep." 
**

He uses adjectives like "good" and "big" to keep it simple for the average listener. He doesn't embellish; he uses mildly crude sentences to get his points across (i.e. saying that "People are falling asleep" at Clinton rallies). 

He's different from the other candidates because he does not talk like a politician; he talks like the average American and unsurprisingly, people like that.
