It's the end of Wk. 1. I'm in Young Research Library (YRL), contemplating my humanity--- go figure, contemplating one's humanity in North Campus, the humanities side of campus.  

Nothing much has happened since my last installment, other than going to all my classes, getting the feel of the TAs and instructors, etc. I really like my Math 32a class (that's the first part of UCLA's multivariable calculus series); the professor is excellent (LOOK UP DAVID J. ARNOLD, his fluid flow modelling research is bomb!!), and he has a cool accent. Lectures are always sharp and clear.

Fun fact: All of our lectures are bruincasted, so anyone can go back and watch them on CCLE (that's UCLA's learning management system.)

BioE10, which is our bioengineering introductory seminar course, is pretty interesting. The TA has a hard-to-understand accent, but other than that, everything's alright.

I've joined BruinSpace, which is a on-campus group that does cool space stuff. I have to write a proposal for an instrument to launch up to space. Bueno beans.

There's some cinnamon toast crunch that's been sitting on my desk. Gonna eat it.

SATURDAY: Woke up, didn't do much. Studied a bit, watched some "Friends." Had Korean Fried Chicken w/ friends. Certainly worth it; BBQ Chicken in Westwood has a 57 dollar family combo meal, so we just split that among 6 people. Definitely worth it!!
