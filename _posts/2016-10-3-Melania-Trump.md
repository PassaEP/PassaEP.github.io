To me, Melania is not the typical first lady purely because of how well equipped she is to be a first lady. 

In the United States, the American culture and following has always sung the praises of the self-made man and the glories of starting with humble origins. Trump, contrary to what Eric may say about the insignificant "million dollar investment," is not a self-made man. The story of Trump Inc. lacks the romanticism of the American narrative. His story does not speak to the average American family. 

But, Melania's story does. She's the daughter of a working class bicycle salesman and factory manager. In high school, she was studious and aspired to be more, just like any other American teenager nowadays. 

To add on, people find Donald Trump to be callous and impulsive at times. 

But, Melania is more reserved and cautious; she's a supermodel, so she's very conscious of the image she projects. This consciousness comes out in the way she walks and talks. 

Basically, Melania is a typical first lady because she's the bacon to the Donald's eggs; she complements him. She brings the utilities to the White House that Trump severely lacks. 

For generations, the President has always relied on the First Lady to complement their image and positions on the issues of the day, whether it be through party planning or launching an anti-drug campaign. 

One of the biggest issues of our day is foreign policy. People don't have confidence in the Donald when it comes to foreign policy. 

Melania is the perfect first lady for this; she's an immigrant, international supermodel, and noted polyglot. 

With all these traits, no one can truly say that Mrs. Trump doesn't belong in the Oval Office. In fact, I believe that she's the most qualified First Lady of our time.
