The Orlando shooter’s wife should not have picked up on the signs of her husband’s aggression. It is obvious that she was abused and oppressed in her own household, and hence, would not have the psychological stature to recognize such symptoms. She loved her husband unconditionally, and this love gave way to her own ignorance. 


She should not be held accountable purely because psychologically, it is apparent that she was in no condition to recognize any psychological abnormalities in her husband. As such, in a court of law, they would have defined testimony from her as invalid because of her lack of mental adequacy.
