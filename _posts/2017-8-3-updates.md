I haven't written enough stuff.. But that'll be changing. 

I vaguely wanted to blog about my research experience at MIPS this summer, but decided against it for confidentiality reasons. This post will serve as a brief recap. 

What I can reveal is that my summer's been good. I've been doing fulfilling work, and meeting lots of smart, interesting people. I still have to finish my last few experiments, prep my research presentation, and finish my actual paper before September. It's a wee bit stressful, but it's a happy kind of stress? 

Common Application opened on Tuesday; UC Application opened yesterday. I sat at the dinnertable and finalized my college list with my parents. I have a ton of essays to write, but then again, I also have a ton of pre-written drafts to use and/or draw off new ideas from (Thanks, Ms. Scoffield!). 

I've been prepping my Septober debate topics as well; though with all the bomb-building that North Korea is doing, the paradigms are changing by the hour. Ugh. 

So, what are my plans for this blog? Excellent question. For my own purposes, I think I'll try to write at least a post a week. I'll be writing a ton of college application essays anyway, so it'll be refreshing to write and vent about issues that aren't deep and interpersonal. 

I'll try blogging about the college application process itself. It'll be good for future reflection and analysis. Furthermore, if by accident, some poor HS student comes across this strange corner of the Internet and draws something from my experience, it'll be worthwhile as well.
