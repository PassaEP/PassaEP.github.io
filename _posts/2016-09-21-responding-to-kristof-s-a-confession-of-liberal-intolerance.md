I agree with Kristof's concerns regarding Conservative discrimination in academic settings. 

The lack of Conservatives in academic settings is detrimental and doing a disservice for students. Diversity of thought in the classroom is *essential* for learning. According to Johnson, et. al of University of Minnesota, "When the student realizes that other students or the teacher have a different conclusion and that they challenge and contest his conclusion, a state of internal conceptual conflict [...] is aroused. The uncertainty motivates an active search [...] for more information, new experiences, and a more adequate cognitive perspective and reasoning process in hopes of resolving the uncertainty." 

Hence, if students do not meet controversy or ideas besides their own, they cannot grow or develop new schema. 

Furthermore, dismissing Conservatives from the conversation is morally wrong. For example, Kristof writes: 

> "To me, the conversation illuminated primarily liberal arrogance — the implication that conservatives don’t have anything significant to add to the discussion." 

To end with, the arguments for the exclusion of Conservatives from academic conversations are eerily familiar to the bigotry and discrimination that Progressives themselves condemn.
