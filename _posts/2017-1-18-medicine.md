Medical TV shows are not dangerous for people to watch; in fact, they are beneficial to the public. Of course, like any other television show, medical TV shows tend to exaggerate with miracle cures and diagnoses or the addition of an overly-romantic side plot, but those components are everywhere in television and contribute to its digestibility by viewers. 

Medicine is a complex field. to the typical patient, it’s riddled with jargon and heartbreak, but to a doctor, it’s riddled with insecurity and frustration. When we visit a doctor, we treat them like they’re omniscient and all-knowing, and in reality, that isn’t conducive. Doctors are human beings, too; they don’t know everything and they make mistakes. Medical shows like Scrubs and Grey’s don’t hide this, unlike your local clinic. These shows do not make an active effort to mislead, often times, they have consultants (Holland 2016). For example, the show ER still showcases the heartbreak of surgery.
