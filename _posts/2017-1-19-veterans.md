No, we do not. Itâ€™s primarily because of the structure of the system itself; while it is government subsidized, the programs are overly bureaucratic and disorganized (Wagner 2015). The system, because of its inefficiencies and overhead, prevent veterans from getting the care they need in a timely manner (Cardona 2017). This is especially true for veterans with mental health problems; the current system puts them at a lower priority than veterans with physical injuries and trauma. By doing this in the current system, we neglect the mental health care needs of veterans and that has led to terrible consequences, such as the Fort Hood Massacre or the Fort Lauderdale Shooting.

The system, furthermore, perpetuates mental health stigma. There are no recorded statistics on the SEAL suicide rate (Kulish & Drew 2016), and the system makes no substantial effort to rehabilitate veterans with mental health problems. This makes everything worse. 
If we want to solve this, we need to make major overhaul to veteran care. We start by privatizing care and allowing veterans to choose their care providers. Privatization will expand care and encourage veterans to get care. Bureaucracy would be reduced; veterans would get their care more efficiently and quickly.
