It has been forever since I last posted. I deleted the atom text editor after a while, no coding. The last post here was about waiting for pi day.  I was, sadly, rejected for that particular college and many more. Since then, I was accepted to the University of California: Los Angeles, and have happily enrolled. I also moved in, tried organizing my life and desk, and began trying to revamp my study habits.

Los Angeles is an interesting place. It's sunny, often, but also hazy and foggy. Westwood, in particular, is full of overpriced goods to cater for the elites of Bel Air and nearby Beverly Hills.

UCLA is an anomaly from this observation; the snooty Quorans who tout the ivy league and "spit" on UCLA ("It's a fine school, but...") or tout Berkeley's ABSOLUTE superiority have bought into the marketing scheme that this a happy, dandy place where flowers grow with every step and all UCLA students are mindless, beachbodies only thinking of the upcoming weekend on Santa Monica Boardwalk.

Well, it's much better than that. We're a bunch of HALF-mindless beachbodies who ponder the upcoming weekend on OBSCURE Santa Monica beaches, not mainstream, consumer filth!

Jokes aside, the people here are brilliant, level-headed, a little arrogant, and a little pragmatic. Math and physics geniuses litter the floors of South Campus. Cool things to know, I guess:

1. Engineering VI is my favorite on-campus building right now. It has a little study lounge on every floor, and can be accessed through the network of bridges. That same network of bridges can take you to Engineering IV and V, as well as the Mathematical Sciences Building AND BOELTER HALL.
2. De Neve is where I live. Delicious dining hall food and stuff. No complaints, very clean accommodations.
3. My UCLA physics 1a (Newtonian Mechanics) class uses OpenStax University Physics, which is an open-source textbook on the OpenStax platform. It's really great that they're trying to lower barriers for people of all socioeconomic backgrounds to access materials and do well in class. Also, open-source textbooks, I'd argue, are subject to more scrutiny and revision because of the sheer nature of their editing process. Continual refinment makes for a better textbook for all students.
4. Chick-fil-a's 6.99 chicken sandwich meal is sooooo worth it. It's my favorite place to eat in Westwood.
5. I think reflection and stuff will help with focus in college. So, I, again, will try to post weekly.
