When I was a nintendo gameboy mashing kindergartner, there was this one establishment in Taft that I loved-- All In A Sandwich (AIAS); AIAS was a simple, no-fancy-avocados deli ran by an old woman out of her decked out and culinarily upgraded living room. If you must know, the "restaurant" (if you can call it that) was a cozy little 1-story hovel adjacent to Adkisson Drive. The highlight of my day would be when my grandmother would pick up the phone and order a sandwich for pickup (typically, on Thursdays, dunno why). All kinds of sandwiches, think tuna, chicken salad, roast beef, turkey clubs.. My mom and I would drive up and retrieve the treasure in these bloated brown burlap bags..

Then, the old woman retired and AIAS became a distant memory.

Add 12 years and I'm in college. Embittered by my sultry, exurban adolescence, but more importantly, HARDENED by my experiences of disappointing sandwich shops. My friends know that I love this one place in Bakersfield called Sequoia Sandwich Shop (SSS), but it can't quite fit into the shoes of AIAS. Sequoia's a fancy, upper middle class establishment with booths and actual chairs. You're supposed to actually SIT THERE and enjoy the sandwich. That's a different type than the AIAS. The meat is Boar's Head brand (translation: the "fancy stuff for all you sandwich neophytes").  

Fat Sal's in Westwood doesn't quite hit the spot either. +12 bucks for a sandwich targeted towards drunken college students? No thanks. I don't care if it has fried chicken fingers, roast beef, bacon, the pope, sour cream and fries.. That Frankenstein is not what I grew up eating in the x-ray room. If my dad knew about such a sandwich, he would probably faint.

But one bite at Bruin Cafe, and I'm doodling rockets in the corner of the office again. It's amazing what a good sandwich can do to you. Over the last few days, I have sampled the sandwich fare at Bruin Cafe, and let me tell ya, this place is amazing.

How it works: basically, one mealplan swipe gets you a refillable drink, chips, and a sandwich. Very filling. Onward to the notable culinary details:

I really enjoy the chicken and tuna salad sandwiches. A lot of places don't do these two types of sandwiches justice; SSS in Bakersfield's chicken salad is this weird premium almalgam of chicken salad, walnuts, and other weird hipster ingredients in between a croissant. Personally, I find the mouthfeel to be a little awkward in this case, as in many cases. The most common chicken salad mistake is just plain shitty chicken.

But BruinCafe doesn't commit any of those sins; it's a simple spread of chicken salad, with lettuce and tomato stacked on top, all stuffed in between a freshly baked roll. The chicken salad is pristine; the vinaigrette-mayo compendium is smooth and viscous, and doesn't drip out of the sandwich at all. Crunchy celery and some other mystery veggie is mixed with the chicken, creating an optimal ratio of crunch and tenderness. The chicken is obviously very fresh; it's not a weird chewy rubberiness, it's cut succinctly enough to feel like little pillows of juicy chicken freshness in your mouth, with the optimal amount of bounceback to remind you that you're eating meat.

The tuna salad follows appropriately with the same vinaigrette-mayo compendium; again, celery is present and executed very well. Bread's the same thing; this boils down, then, to a question of the tuna. A lot of disgusting places will just open of that Starkist canned tuna nonsense, mix it with mayo, stick it in between two pieces of bread and try to sell it as tuna. A gross and unfortunately common sin.

But BruinCafe does justice for tuna! There's a slight hint of that saline sea scent on the sandwich, and it lingers as a subtle aftertaste; it's not an annoyingly fishy taste, it's the taste of real fresh fish. The mayo-vinaigrette compendium (MVC) doesn't try to become a cloak that obfuscates the fish. Rather, the MVC complements the tuna well, giving this rich sweetness to hone the merciless bite of the sea.

BCafe's real value to me, though, is the Cuban ham sandwich. A backstory first:
AIAS actually didn't serve Cubans back in the day, but Bytes Café at Stanford University did. Bytes is the eating establishment on the first floor of the Packard Electrical Engineering Building at Stanford, and on my first research internship during Summer 2015, the Cuban was the menu's highlight to me. Stanford, unfortunately, has a penchant for overly healthy food meant for cows. The Cuban was a slight departure from that, tender shredded roast pork in between a bun. Some notes of acidity and sourness, but it was good. Really messy and sort of juicy and greasy. Not my favorite sandwich, but I've tried to find another Cuban on the same level.

But UCLA's Cuban Ham sandwich at BCafe well surpasses Stanford's Cuban at Bytes Café. First, the bread. The bread is lightly toasted; when you bite in, before applying the maximum amount of mandibular force, there is a point when the instantantaneous force when you just hear... CRACK... It's not hard, it's not uncomfortable for your teeth. It doesn't give way too easily either, not a soft soggy mess like the one at Stanford's. No. This sandwich's bread wants you to work a little bit, and doesn't want to just fall apart. It has some resistance left in it.

What of the insides? Unlike the Stanford Bytes Cuban, UCLA BCafe Cuban has melted swiss cheese adhered to the bread. When I was unwrapped the sandwich, the cheese had actually leaked on to the wrapper and was serving as a glue. The melted cheese smell is intoxicating and serves it job of toning down the inherent rich bulkiness of the bread. It's more of a subtle butteriness to the sandwich, it doesn't quite shine as much as the other elements, but I don't think it needs to. It sets the stage for the mess of mayo and meat juices in the center.

that brings me to the meat. A simple layer of black forest ham surrounding some shredded roast pork. So simple, but so innovative. The black forest ham is very typical; you taste the saltiness and sweet notes of the ham, as well as those trace flavors of the caramelization on the edges. The phenomenon is how this black forest ham interacts with the shredded roast pork. I don't think his shredded roast pork is a purist in style, not as Cuban as the Stanford Cuban; it reminds me more of a hybrid between Cuban roast pork and Mexican carnitas, which I think, affords it more advantages. The slight sour salty juiciness surrounded in black forest ham is a pleasant surprise and mouth feel. The black forest ham is a less tender cut, but the shredded roast pork falls apart so willingly. It's not a soggy mess like the Stanford sandwich either.

The single pickle on the side of the sandwich cuts through the heaviness of all the other elements, balancing it all out.

In short, UCLA's BCafe Cuban ham sandwich is pragmatic. I can eat this walking to class. I can eat this in class. However, it's a sandwich with nostalgia. The moment I bit into this, I thought of my days munching sandwiches in Taft as a young child, or navigating the hallowed halls of Stanford or buying carnitas for the first time at the Mountain House taco truck. This is the type of sandwich that experiences life honestly, none of that frilly nonsense. Compared to other sandwiches I've had, it's not the best or the fanciest in terms of ingredients themselves (it's from a university cafe after all), but as a whole eating experience, I would say this sandwich takes the cake easily.
