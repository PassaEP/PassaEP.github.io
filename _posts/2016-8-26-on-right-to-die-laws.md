According to the CDC, terminal diseases are the leading cause of hospital deaths in the United States. Dying from a terminal disease is often a costly ordeal, both monetarily and emotionally, and for many of these patients, death is the inevitable result. With modern medicine, there are ways to avoid the prolonged suffering. States like Vermont, Washington, and Oregon have passed “Right to Die” laws, allowing patients with terminal diseases to ‘pull the plug’ at will. Those against “Right to Die” laws often cite that giving terminally ill patients the choice is immoral and will usher in a new age of indifference in medical care (Smith 2016). However, I believe that “Right to Die” laws do the opposite; by allowing patients to make that decision of their free will, the medical industry is forced to acknowledge the social and moral pillars of patient care. 
	
Consider the social ramifications of passing “Right to Die” laws. John Locke noted that individuals’ rights in a society were maximized, so long as they did not threaten the rights and safety of others, and that, in fact, individuals should act in a way that benefits the society (Locke 1689). Hospitals and hospices are a part of society; they take care of the sick. By making the choice to die, a terminally ill patient gives up more than their life; they give up their claims to organs, to drugs, to monetary resources, and to patient care. By giving up all those resources, those resources go to someone else in the healthcare system who may have a better chance at living than that terminally ill patient. 

From an economic standpoint, it is simply more fiscally responsible to pass “Right to Die” laws. Many of these terminally ill patients are elderly and dependent on federal services such as Medicare and Social Security, which are subsidized by taxpayers. By letting these terminally ill patients “go,” we stop paying for the subsidies and support that may go into their treatment. Considering how bloated both programs are (the US government spent 1.8 trillion dollars on Medicare and Social Security in 2014 (Boccia, Heritage.org), saving any amount of money would be beneficial. 

For these reasons, “Right to Die” laws do more that just empower terminally ill patients; they advocate for an ideal of socioeconomic responsibility in the health care industry and should be legislated.
