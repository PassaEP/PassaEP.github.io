To begin with, I would describe myself as ambivalent and unfocused; I find it very difficult to focus on a singular thing or make up my mind about an issue or activity. In everything I do, there’s always something else in my mind or influencing me, which honestly, is counterproductive. 


This description could be indicative of my diverse experiences; I’ve been profoundly influenced by people of polarized, disparate walks of life, ranging from the hyper-religious to the atheist naysayers, and the top 1% to the blue collar oilfield laborer. As such, I find sympathies with people of all shapes and sizes. 


I have not changed much. I still view problems and issues with a level of indifference that people find alarming, and often, when I do act opinionated, it’s for the sake of my own sick entertainment. I do enjoy argumentation for the sake of argument; I am disgusted when people repackage and rehash ideas without an ounce of their own original thought, citing the “greats” like Locke and Rousseau, without realizing what Locke and Rousseau truly meant. I think thoroughly and read every piece of text in it all its unabridged glory or mediocrity.
