I still remember the day Professor Lin put the time-independent schrodinger equation on the board. Summer 2018 in Young Hall 4069.

The phi symbol, the hamiltonian, in all their  glory, etched in Lin's neon colored chalks. "Don't worry," he assured us. "It's all just rigorous algebra."

As the quarter progressed, he threw around terms like "second order linear differential equation", "eigenvalue", and "eigenfunction". My most recent mathematical exposure was Calculus BC with my high school teacher, so I was of course, daunted.

Fast forward to now, when Professor Corbin etched four solutions to the simple harmonic oscillator equations on the board. The "scariest" one was the complex form with the coefficient i.

"Differential equations don't make much sense in math," he admitted. "They make more sense in physics!"

Now, here I am, trying to learn the mathematics behind the oscillators and circuits that I've loved for so long. Hell, I used to religiously read papers from Christopher Voigt's Lab and Erik Winfree's Lab at Caltech. I was a funny kid, I guess.

Reading research papers as a bioengineering student makes more sense as the BE curriculum and all the prerequisities ensure that one has a bird's eye view of everything relevant to the field. The problem is, when joining a lab or trying to innovate in the field, a bird's eye view is simply not enough.

The intuition and understanding is the gateway to unique insights and questions, and we can't quite get to that level if we're daunted by the vernacular of the surrounding concepts... In this case, it's mathematics...

To describe molecular circuits and feedback systems, differential equations are the norm. Very complex differential equations and statistical mechanics are the norm. Real analysis, nonlinear dynamics, all the norm.

So of course, I'm quite scared. I'm not as "rigorous" with my mathematics as some of my peers. Heck, I was terrible at the AMC exam...

You see, there is lore and legend surrounding the math geniuses of old. Richard Feynman was notoriously mathematically gifted; a special type of integration technique was dubbed after him because he would always use it solve scary integrals that the other MIT men would try and fail at. Eric Lander was a competitor at the IMO. Erik DeMaine (the other origami dude) was a math god.  Margaret Kivelson noticed her own precociousness at mathematics back in high school. The list goes on and on.

As dreamer of science, my greatest insecurity was being average to slightly above average in math. Sure, I had the scores to get into UCLA engineering, and my math scores were the "normal scores" for other top-tier engineering programs. By "normal", I mean perfect. But I wasn't a USAMO competitor or IMO aspirant. No, I'm just an average mathematician.

I was surprised when my Calculus BC teacher even let me touch Ross' Elementary Analysis; I was definitely too mediocre to read the book, much less so to take it home.

But as an engineer (and future researcher, fingers crossed), mathematics is a tool, language, and lense. It allows us to see, examine, and communicate otherwise overly complex systems in ways one wouldn't be able to imagine. I guess it's ridiculous for an American author to be afraid of the English language, so I have to stop being afraid, too.
....
I read the first chapter of Del Vecchio and Murray's *Biological Feedback* and recognized the equations as ordinary first order differentials (rate kinetics stuff), so that's a start, I guess. I think I can solve them because they look like oscillator models?

I hope these are the insights I'm supposed to be making, and that I'm not an utter buffoon.
