Church pastors should be allowed to participate in certain political causes, but not others. The United States believes in secular law; laws are made by men, for men. Pastors are meant to spread the gospel of God and Christianity; Christianity itself has no explicit law framework (unlike Islam and Sharia), so it is acceptable for pastors to advocate for certain political causes (primarily social issues) with moral and religious reasons because these reasons are subjective to the believers. 
	
To elaborate, it would actually be advisable for pastors to be active in sociopolitical causes. Even with America’s diversity in modern times, 89% of Americans are monotheistic and have pastors and church leaders. Since so many Americans attend church and are active in local religion, politically active pastors would increase their self-awareness about current issues. These Americans would be better galvanized and equipped to participate in the democratic practices that are so integral to the function of our country. 

For fiscal political causes, pastors should not be allowed to participate in these causes or use religious advocation in them. While Christianity does have principles regarding business operations and economics, these are all primarily rooted in notions of morality and divinity. Modern business is secular and focused on one thing: the shareholders. To businessmen and shareholders, the profit margins are the lifeline of the company, not its morality in business practices. In fact, the most lucrative business sectors, banking, technology, manufacturing, pharmaceuticals and venture capital, are all notorious for questionably dubious business practices, but account for a substantial proportion of the American GDP. A pastor’s morals and reasonings would not lead to these profits and financial successes, and even if they did, they would not be on the same scale. 

Government’s role in business should be minimal anyway; the government’s only obligation is to pass policies that facilitate strong economies and entrepreneurship. The economic theories and methodologies that go into proposing these policies are based on tangible, empirical data and research. Subjective notions such as religion and morality have no place in this decisionmaking process, so pastors would not have anything substantial or useful to contribute to the conversation. 

The political activism of pastors has been shown to bring reform and change, as seen with Martin Luther King Jr.. It is necessary, however, to distinguish the areas of politics that would have something to gain from a pastor’s perspective. By better understanding their optimal roles in political activism, pastors and Americans democracy alike benefit.
