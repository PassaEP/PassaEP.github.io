Things like the Holocaust are especially not off-limits. Making sensitive topics like the Holocaust off-limits draws a line on speech. Proponents like Parks (2015) say that that satire must conform to social norms. However, I strongly disagree. According to John Stuart Mill, all forms of expression (like satire) have intrinsic value. Censorship will do more harm than good. 

Satire cannot be restricted; if it is, it loses its intrinsic value. We cannot restrict any forms of expression, because they all have value. For an issue like Islam or the Holocaust, censorship is not the solution to discussion. In fact, the more controversial the satire is, the better; controversy makes people talk about these issues. 

The loss of value to satire lessens possible political or social impacts, We cannot draw lines; there is no clear standard for drawing lines on racy content, and hence, we cannot draw lines because of the risks.
