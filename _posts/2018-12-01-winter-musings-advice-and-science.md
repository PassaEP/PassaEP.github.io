It's December 1st, kiddos. For those of us on the quarter system, it's almost finals. RIP my grades.

First, the lighthearted. It rained on Thursday, and quite hard if you ask me. Walking back to the Hill from Bruinspace in the rain via the tennis courts was actually quite pretty. The tennis courts are lined with little streetlights, and at night, with the rain, it all just glitters against the brick paved path (sorry for clichés). Reminds me of Audrey Hepburn movies and Rhett Butler.

Ariana Grande released a new song "thank you, next"; it's surprisingly catchy, music video's pretty cute too; basically, you get these scenes where Ariana is in these '90s  rom coms like Mean Girls and Legally Blonde. Nice to see more UCLA scenery featured in overconsumed American media.

I read something quite disturbing on Friday. There was this New York Times article (I'll link it in the comments section) about this unaccredited private school that was abusing kids and fabricating transcripts, personal statements, the works, for college applications. Obviously, this is an extreme case, but it's evident of the stupidity and twistedness of the college application process; you expect young people from incredibly different backgrounds to somehow package their hopes and dreams into arbitrary set of numbers and essays, judge and compare them based on highly subjective criterion, then send the fat and skinny envelopes accordingly.

The fact that this private school was "gaming" the system and that the "ivy and ivy+" unis were eating it all up is absolutely disgusting. Even sadder when you realize that there are probably some socioeconomically disadvantaged kids who probably actually deserved to go to these schools, but now might be blacklisted by adcoms based on the school they go to. If anyone reading this is going through college apps, I advice you to please be honest on your applications and be yourself.. Overly said advice, but if a college doesn't accept you for you, well, then it's probably not the right place for you.
...
I've began searching for a lab, wrote up an updated "college" CV in LaTeX. Upon re-vamping and re-writing the CV based on my last bits of what I did in high school and the past year, it made me think upon a question I often got in high school that I probably didn't adequately answer often.

"How did you get internship experience?" (in my case, they were mostly in research at a top university "near" my house). The short answer (and the same that you can probably get off Quora), is that I emailed a lot of people and got truly lucky. Now in college, as a bioengineering major, I'm asked, "How do you know so many different lab techniques/how do you know so much about the  of the field?" Similar answer.

A better answer is that, in high school, you don't really need to do "research" at anywhere fancy. If you want science research experience, you can probably find it at your local CC as well; I'd be willing to bet there are some CC professors who need someone to clean up their labs, and you can get experience with that too. If you can't get experience or it's really hard to find stuff, just.. READ. Also, if you aren't great with lab stuff at first, it's cool. You get better with practice.

Anecdote: When I was fresh out of 8th grade, I went to this local biotech summer camp to go learn "wet lab stuff". We did procedures like electrophoresis and bacteria transformation, and if you ask my old friend whom I carpooled with, I was an absolute klutz in the lab. My pipetting was... really bad; the little solutions weren't mixing because I would push too hard on the plunger. My electrophoresis failed miserably. Lab journal was intelligible.

 My friend, honestly, was a lot better at it than me.. But even though I sucked, and my parents told me I sucked, even after the camp, I just kept reading and learning. Like, in my freetime, I read scientific papers in a lot of stuff in BioE like genetic circuits, optogenetics, etc., as well as stuff in EE like lightfields, mobile cameras for glaucoma diagnosis, the list goes on. Quanta Magazine and Wired are still my favorite publications, honestly.

  I read somewhere later on, that if you spend an hour on something everyday for like 10 years, you'll become an expert or some BS like that; sort of same concept here.. I was really interested in this stuff, and I guess, knowledge is a cumulative thing.

  My school didn't offer many opportunities in this unless you were in PLTW, but just reading about what people are doing in labs far away from the speck of dirt called Mountain House, serves as a decent ideological and motivational impetus to find and do more.

  If you are persistent and you read, and you email people to ask questions about what their research, innovations, etc. entail, someone will eventually see something in you, and you might have an opportunity there. So it just boils down to trying really hard not because you want research on your resumé, but because you want to start "be[ing] in the room[s] where it happen[s]". So yeah, if you want it badly enough (I guess this goes for all opportunities), opportunity will find you.

With that in mind, I need to go back to finals studying. Good luck!

P.S. For all those UT fans, HOOK 'EM!
