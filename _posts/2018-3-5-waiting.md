I'm sitting in stats, with a pair of Oakley sunglasses on my face. A peculiar sight, indeed. My right eye is swollen; McCoy thinks it's stye eye, and worse case, pink eye. There's phlegm teeming in my throat and nose. I sucked on a cherry Halls, and a lemon Halls this morning. 

It's March 5th. Rumor has it that Caltech decisions will be out on March 10th, and MIT on March 14th, 3:28 PM PST. 

Oh, the fated days. 

The agony is knowing that all my other friends have gotten news. While, I'm happy about that, the fact that all I have is a Stanford rejection right now scares the shit out of me. 

I really like MIT. I don't think I've liked any other school quite as much, except UChi. I poured my heart into the MIT prompts; I truly hope there's something here for me. 

My eye aches. Nat Quals is on Friday, and I am sick. Lucky ducks, indeed.
