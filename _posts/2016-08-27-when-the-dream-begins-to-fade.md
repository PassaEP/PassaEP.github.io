I'm trying very hard to get back into math.

Well, not **very** hard by Asian standards, but still pretty hard by **my** standards. Getting a 30/35 on my last math test was a tad bit demoralizing. 

But I'm having fun again, I guess. So, that's good.

I feel like I've spent the last 2 years of high school trying to find the "perfect" zone of comfort. I was very highstrung freshman year, and put too much on my plate (sports, nearly every academic club on campus, ASB, school board). That led to bad results. 

I played it relatively safe during sophomore year, only handling a few clubs, taking my spot as concertmistress, and some personal web development projects. That was a nice cruise. By the end of 2nd semester, I spent the nights of finals playing video games and reading bad manga. I was satisfied, but not happy. Far from it, in fact. I always felt like there was something missing and could never quite put a finger on it. That was very frustrating. 

And now here I am again, trying to get my mojo (?) back. It hurts even more when I was practicing some contest problems and realized sadly that at some point in my life, I was able to take problems like that down for dinner all day, everyday. 

I went to the AP Psych teacher, Mr. Schallhorn, for advice. He told me to just keep practicing and be patient. In about a *MONTH*, I would be back in form. 

I hate being patient. I have problems with waiting on other people. I have even more problems with waiting on myself. 

But somehow, I still feel like I'm having fun. I haven't felt that way in a while.
