Sugary drinks should not be taxed any more than regular drinks because this taxation is an infringement on liberty, disproportionately affects lower income people, and finally, does not reflect the interests of New York’s people. 

Taxation of sugary drinks is an infringement of liberty because by taxing sugary drinks, the government has more control of the public’s health choices. The court struck down the tax in that it was not a clear move by New York City’s health department meant to improve health, and that past initiatives were more direct and infringed on less liberties (Pigott 2014). So, in fact, the soda tax infringes on liberties and may not even be conducive towards health improvement. Additionally, from an economic perspective, the tax puts beverage companies who focus on sugary soft drinks at an unfair disadvantage. 

Furthermore, the tax disproportionately affects lower income New Yorkers. Dutch nutrition researcher Matijn Katan said that the tax could dissuade consumption of more expensive fruits and vegetables, and encourage consumption of cheaper, less nutritious foods in this demographic (Grymbaum 2012). Due to this impact, the tax is inherently discriminatory and violates the Fourteenth Amendment, so it is unconstitutional and should be abolished. 

Finally, the tax itself does not reflect the interests of New Yorkers. According to a poll conducted by the New York Times, 60% of respondents opposed the tax. Many cited its invasion of liberties and unfair treatment of beverage companies. A phrase echoed frequently in American history is, “No taxation without representation!”; that is, if taxation is not consented by the populace, it should not be implemented.
