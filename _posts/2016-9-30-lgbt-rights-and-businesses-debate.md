The affirmative case argues that businesses have a moral and economic obligation to advocate for LGBT rights. The affirmative cites the increasing presence of companies in times of human need (i.e. Airbnb’s free accommodations to victims of the Nepalese earthquake, Facebook and Google’s Peoplefinder tools), and applies this logic to the plight of LGBT people. Economically, the affirmative cites data showing a correlation between more expansive LGBT rights and productive economies. Finally, the affirmative argues that by doing business in a certain country or area, they are supposed to follow “the laws and cultural mores.” 

The negative case argues that businesses have no obligation to advocate for LGBT rights; it would be in the best interests of states and businesses if businesses took actions based on the profit margins, not the morality. The negative argues that by giving businesses these obligations, states and governing bodies are inadvertently allowed to shirk their responsibilities as advocates for LGBT rights. Finally, the speaker argues also that LGBT-friendly states should be doing more to pressure other non-LGBT friendly states into reform and that while some businesses have advocated effectively for LGBT people, states and governments are far more effective at ushering in reform overall. 

I agree with the negative case; while LGBT advocating businesses should be applauded, they should not be expected to advocate for LGBT rights. By imposing this obligation on businesses, we limit the way businesses operate and hence, undermine the free market. Economist Milton Friedman once said:
  
>“The great virtue of a free market system is that it does not care what color people are; it does not care what their religion is; it only cares whether they can produce something you want to buy. It is the most effective system [...] to enable people who hate one another to deal with one another and help one another.” 

From this quote, Friedman believes the free market to be more than the elegant systems of exchange that run our world; he thinks of them as facilitators of exchange and compromise between parties that would otherwise conflict with one another.

For LGBT rights, then, it would be better to have businesses operate without advocation or social justice in mind; by operating like usual, businesses force non-LGBT friendly parties to associate and exchange with LGBT friendly parties. These mutually beneficial exchanges are the best way that businesses can bring reform without risking profit margins. Furthermore, any other drastic provocations or hostilities that may punish LGBT advocation in non-LGBT friendly regions (i.e. the Middle East, Southeast Asia, Central Africa) are circumvented. 

In the end, no action is the best course of action for businesses.
