Perception is key to how we interpret satire. There are various different perceptions that we can have, which show how interpretations can be so varied and complicated.

Shows like Colbert Report poke fun at politics and news, but ultimately convey that the issues of our day are inevitable. This perception of inevitability gives way to a sense of nihilism. For example, in 2008, the *International Journal of Public Opinion Research* found that such shows actually decreases democratic participation. This is an example of a large population being discouraged and hence, influenced by satire. 

However, we can also argue that satire does have value, because it educates audiences. Audiences use satire as a "starting point" to do more research about important issues. For example, the Pew Research Center found in 2007 that viewers do research after watching the shows.
