Good satire makes you think. I believe that for satire to fulfill its purpose, the reader must question whether or not it's satire. 

Fallon (2016) claims that if there needs to be a clarification for satire, it's not good satire. She argues further that satire is just another front for bigotry. She cites Calvin Trillin's poem about cuisine as an example of this. 

I strongly disagree with her position. Expressing irony and everything wrong with these fallacies points out how a certain practice is wrong. Trillin's piece points out what bigotry really is, and the problems with it.
