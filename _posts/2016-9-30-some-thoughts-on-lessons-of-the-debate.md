The article notes the overall shortcomings of the debate, citing the numerous criticisms of Donald Trump’s “boorishness.” The writer laments that the debate had no resemblance to the great Lincoln-Douglas debates of American past. The article then compares the two candidates to their respective predecessors. Clinton is painted as a choppy rehash of the Obama administration and Trump-- well, Trump is nothing like Romney and the Republican nominees of yore. The author concludes by wondering how and why the Republican Party has managed to get a nominee that departs so far from standard conservative values. 

As a young Conservative, Trump’s criticisms of free trade, sympathies to protectionism, and friendliness with the soon-to-be “democratically” re-elected, Vladimir Putin (see my other blog post), are a major reason for my objection of him. There are, however, a few more reasons, and I will begin to detail those. 

He’s not a Conservative in heart or mind; he’s a narcissistic businessman with a history of racist, sexist, and bigoted remarks. The man is walking fodder for the tabloids. He only became recently “religious” to win with Evangelical voters, and according to a Newsweek report, one of Trump’s many subsidiaries violated the US-Cuba Embargo. While I do sympathize with his “free market” ideology, Cuba, for years, had openly undermined NATO, the free world and the United States as a whole. What does this say about him, then, if he is so willing to shirk morality, patriotism, and international camaraderie to marginally increase share prices? 

Back in 2012, the Republican Establishment did all they could to bar Mitt Romney from the nomination, saying that he was not a true conservative, that RomneyCare was an act of Nazi socialism, and that Romney’s Mormonism threatened critical Evangelical voting blocs. They called him a loser, and did all they could to brand him into “the perfect Conservative” during the primary season. they took a Conservative that people believed in and turned him into they thought was good for the Establishment.  

To the GOP Establishment, I say this, the way the great Angelica Schuyler Church would have put it: 

“Congratulations. You have invented a new kind of stupid.” It’s 2016 now, and you’ve made the American conservative base so angry and mangled that they have nominated The Donald. It’s not because they are all racist and/or bigoted, but because you have, for years, ignored their pleas. I wish you the best in the coming election cycle. I was once a young Republican, but now I am a young Libertarian who is canvassing for Gary Johnson.
