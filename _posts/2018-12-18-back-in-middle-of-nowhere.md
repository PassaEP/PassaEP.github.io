Being back in my hometown for 3 weeks confers mixed feelings.

After a full summer quarter of utter abuse by the lower division chem 20 sequence, and a less extreme (but nonetheless brutal) slaughter in the fall by Physics 1A, I associate this sad little strip of land with a troubled upbringing. I didn't even learn the righthand rule here. My friends came armed with tanks, but I had a lone potato shooter. The only thing decent that I gained academically here was a decent understanding of calculus..

I'll admit, though, the English department did a decent job. Paper writing could be a lot worse than it is for me, and I surprisingly, I do decent in those classes. Sitting in my house, watching my brother do homework, only reminds me of my own childhood here. Oh, how little did I know! If I could tell my high school self one thing, it would be to stop taking shortcuts and actually learn the material to one's bones.

My father warned me about my inadequacies long ago, but did I listen? Nah. But, that's youth. Ignorance and deafness. I could blame my teachers, but that wouldn't be very fair. Their hands were tied by an administration hellbent on some twisted "blended learning" initiative.. Well, FYI, to anyone who's reading this, if you go to a top school, your high school education (especially the one Mountain House High) will be inadequate compared to your peers. (Your peers will probably hail from well-known public and private academies with far more honor than yours.) If you go to a random CSU, or a UC that isn't Cal or UCLA--- you'll be alright. As the classes at top schools are curved, good luck trying to be above the hump (especially in STEM classes). It's hard, but you can do it. I've just gotten above it with a lot of work and revampment of my study habits.

I've set some learning goals this winter break, so I hopefully don't just end up playing Overwatch until my brains bust.

1. Learn TensorFlow.
2. Review some stuff about waves and e&m.
3. Learn how to do SOLDEs for good ol' simple harmonic motion.
4. Review cpp.

4 seems enough. I've decided to take Brent Corbin's Physics 1B class at UCLA; supposedly, his tests will be very hard, but he seems to be a bit more generous with A's (30-40% historically) and he's an old professor who's been teaching well for 30 years.. Sun Tzu has some rando saying about knowing the enemy and the battlefield, and knowing yourself.

I've tried to get back into Overwatch, but the toxicity of the 14 year old boys is annoying. I've tried revisiting old books (The Hobbit) and anime (check out Yuri! on Ice, it's a very interesting yaoi? anime).
